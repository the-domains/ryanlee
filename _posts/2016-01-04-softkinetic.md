SoftKinetic is a leading gesture recognition technology company. In 2011, SoftKinetic was getting ready to launch a new gesture-based, depth and dimensional sensing image platform to their product offering. They realized that their brand identity had to align with this new offering.

When developing SoftKinetic's refreshed identity, Method looked to new metaphors for gesture, moving away from the accepted principle of the human form. Instead, we aimed to create an identity that invited gesture and responded to it. The resulting identity is a wordmark connected by texture and frame.

Used together, they are able to indicate gesture statically. We integrated the idea of kinetics through an optical pattern that was malleable and gave the impression of motion and interaction to express the brand. Applied globally, the new SoftKinetic brand identity represents their offering and company core.
